# Using-K-Means-To-Reduce-Colors-In-Image

In Image quantization we use the k mean algorithm to reduce the number of pixel in the image so that the image can be
displayed in the same way with reduced color. The colors in the image are basically classified into one of the specified
number of clusters. The initial mean are taken as three random values from within the image matrix
